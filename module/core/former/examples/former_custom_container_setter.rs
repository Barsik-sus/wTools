// Example former_custom_container_setter.rs

//!
//! This example demonstrates the use of container setters to manage complex nested data structures with the `Former` trait, focusing on a parent-child relationship structured around a container `HashMap`. Unlike typical builder patterns that add individual elements using subform setters, this example uses a container setter to manage the entire collection of children.
//!
//! #### Custom Subform Setter
//!
//! The `child` function within `ParentFormer` is a custom subform setter that plays a crucial role. It uniquely employs the `ChildFormer` to add and configure children by their names within the parent's builder pattern. This method demonstrates a powerful technique for integrating subformers that manage specific elements of a containerâ€”each child entity in this case.

//! #### Subform Setter vs. Container Setter
//!
//! It's important to distinguish between a subform setter and a container setter:
//! - **Subform Setter**: This returns a former of an element within a container, providing an interface to individually form each element. In this example, `child` acts as a subform setter, allowing for the addition and configuration of individual `Child` entities within the `Parent`'s `HashMap`.
//! - **Container Setter**: Conversely, a container setter returns a former of the container itself, offering an interface to manage the container as a whole rather than its individual elements. It would be used if one needed to apply configurations or validations to the entire `HashMap` of children, rather than to individual children.
